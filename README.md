## Introduction

Paathshala is an educational website that will help you become a great Programmer with courses tailored for anyone and everyone - a beginner can start learning from scratch & a novice and brush up on their skills.
Students will have access to a variety of video courses at ease
One of the best ways to learn is to write your code as often as possible. Hence, we have provided students with their Web IDE to write code on their own.
We have created a discussion forum where students can post their doubts. These doubts will be attended to by the instructor.
The problem which we solved is giving all features at one stop which is needed to learn development and programming language
As in our website, there are different features like web editor, Videos for a programming language, quiz section, live streaming, and discussion forum
In this, we offer various types of programming videos like C++, DSA in java, and web development which can be accessed on our courses page and we provide resources for each video.
Web Editor & Live lecture. An online web IDE made by us so that student can practice their web dev code in one place.
Talking about Live Classes in the future we will implement this live streaming model in our website so the student can learn with live lecture.
We also have "Gyan" section which contains brain-teasers and quiz which helps to increase the thinking and imagination power of the students. We also have motivational videos section where the student can listen to his role-models and learn about their journey. "Gyan" section also has a section where the students can upload their projects and take motivation from each other and upskill themselves.
Discussion forum & Chat system
We offer a discussion platform where students and instructors can post doubt and get answered their doubt it is a healthy discussion forum where doubt related to programming can be solved
